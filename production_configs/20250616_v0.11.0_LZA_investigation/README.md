# LZA investigation

We are currently investigation some discrepancy observed at LZA with the Crab. For this purpose a few alternative simulations with different atmosphere have been simulated.
The objective is to process the same way as the standard production

Parameters used for production are identical to 20240918_v0.10.12_allsky_nsb_grid with modification of 20250212_v0.10.17_allsky_interp_dl2_irfs.
The RF used are the one of the standard productions.
