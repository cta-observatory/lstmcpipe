# PROD 20250601_v0.11.0_allsky_nsb_grid_retrain_models

This production is needed to retrain the models with lstchain v0.11.0 due to an incompatibility with the latest scikit-learn version.
See issue https://github.com/cta-observatory/cta-lstchain/issues/1366 


Here we only do the training and testing again.
Configs generated with `make.sh`. lstchain version in configs changed manually to v0.11.0
